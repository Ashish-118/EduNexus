00:00.000 --> 00:03.300
Let's look at Google interviews and let's see what you can find.

00:03.300 --> 00:06.300
There is a long building on which there are 100 islands.

00:06.300 --> 00:09.300
That is, there are hundreds of floors from one to 100.

00:09.300 --> 00:12.300
Now, there is a special floor called N number.

00:12.300 --> 00:15.000
If something falls from that floor, it will break.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.300
But if it falls from the lower floor, it will not break.

00:18.300 --> 00:21.600
And what we have given is that we have given 2 special undying.

00:21.600 --> 00:24.800
If we fall from the upper floor, it will break.

00:24.800 --> 00:28.400
But if it falls from the lower floor, it will not break.

00:28.500 --> 00:31.500
We have to know that for any value of N,

00:31.500 --> 00:35.500
if we only use 2 eggs and find out what N is,

00:35.500 --> 00:39.000
then I will have to fall from the lower floor as many times as possible.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
And then, you will get 1 second of the last one.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.500
But if you find out before that, then I will comment below and tell you.

00:44.500 --> 00:46.000
Today, we will meet again in the next video.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
Till then, keep learning and keep exploring.
