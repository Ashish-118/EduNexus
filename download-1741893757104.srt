00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
Let's look at Google interviews and let's see what you can find.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,300
There is a long building on which there are 100 islands.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,300
That is, there are hundreds of floors from one to 100.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,300
Now, there is a special floor called N number.

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,000
If something falls from that floor, it will break.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,300
But if it falls from the lower floor, it will not break.

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,600
And what we have given is that we have given 2 special undying.

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,800
If we fall from the upper floor, it will break.

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,400
But if it falls from the lower floor, it will not break.

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,500
We have to know that for any value of N,

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,500
if we only use 2 eggs and find out what N is,

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,000
then I will have to fall from the lower floor as many times as possible.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And then, you will get 1 second of the last one.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,500
But if you find out before that, then I will comment below and tell you.

15
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,000
Today, we will meet again in the next video.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Till then, keep learning and keep exploring.
