0	3300	Let's look at Google interviews and let's see what you can find.
3300	6300	There is a long building on which there are 100 islands.
6300	9300	That is, there are hundreds of floors from one to 100.
9300	12300	Now, there is a special floor called N number.
12300	15000	If something falls from that floor, it will break.
15000	18300	But if it falls from the lower floor, it will not break.
18300	21600	And what we have given is that we have given 2 special undying.
21600	24800	If we fall from the upper floor, it will break.
24800	28400	But if it falls from the lower floor, it will not break.
28500	31500	We have to know that for any value of N,
31500	35500	if we only use 2 eggs and find out what N is,
35500	39000	then I will have to fall from the lower floor as many times as possible.
39000	41000	And then, you will get 1 second of the last one.
41000	44500	But if you find out before that, then I will comment below and tell you.
44500	46000	Today, we will meet again in the next video.
46000	48000	Till then, keep learning and keep exploring.
